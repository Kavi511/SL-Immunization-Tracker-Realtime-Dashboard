## **🏥 Data Relationship and Transformation Guide**
This section I try **establishes data relationships and applies transformation processes** to integrate **Primary Research Data** with **Epidemiology Data** for vaccine-related analysis.

1. **Relationship: Vaccine Types** 

📊 Understanding the Data

✅ Primary Research Data: Contains multiple entries for each vaccine type due to various reported adverse events.

✅ Epidemiology Data: Also has multiple entries for each vaccine type, tracking different adverse events over time.

🔄 Recommended Relationship Setup

Cardinality: 🟢 Many-to-Many

Cross-Filter Direction: 🔄 Both

⚙️ Action Steps

🛠 Data Preparation

📌 Ensure consistency in vaccine type names (e.g., "MMR" vs. "Measles-Mumps-Rubella").

📌 Format the relevant columns as Text data type.

🔗 Creating the Relationship

1️⃣ In Model View, drag the Types of Vaccines column from the Primary Research table to the Vaccine Type column in the Epidemiology table.

2️⃣ In the Edit Relationship dialog:

Cardinality: 🟢 Many-to-Many

Cross-Filter Direction: 🔄 Both

3️⃣ Click OK to confirm.

2. **Relationship: Age Group**

📊 Understanding the Data

✅ Primary Research Data: Uses age groups (e.g., "0–5", "6–10").

✅ Epidemiology Data: Contains individual ages (e.g., 4, 7, 12).

🔄 Recommended Relationship Setup

Data Transformation Needed: Convert individual ages into the same age ranges as the Primary Research Data.

⚙️ Action Steps

🛠 Creating Age Groups in Epidemiology Data

1️⃣ Open Power Query Editor.

2️⃣ Select the Epidemiology table.

3️⃣ Add a new custom column named Age Group using the following logic:

```
= if [Age] >= 0 and [Age] <= 5 then "0–5"
  else if [Age] >= 6 and [Age] <= 10 then "6–10"
  else if [Age] >= 11 and [Age] <= 15 then "11–15"
  else "16+"
```

4️⃣ Adjust the age ranges as necessary.

5️⃣ Close and apply the changes.

🔗 Creating the Relationship

1️⃣ In Model View, drag the Age Group column from the Primary Research table to the Age Group column in the Epidemiology table.

2️⃣ In the Edit Relationship dialog:

Cardinality: 🟢 Many-to-Many

Cross-Filter Direction: 🔄 Both

3️⃣ Click OK to confirm.
